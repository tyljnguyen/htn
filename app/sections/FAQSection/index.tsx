      question: "What is a hackathon?",
      answer:
        "Hackathons are collaborative multi-day events where participants (also called hackers) bring their ideas to life by building innovative projects from scratch using software development principals. Aside from just being coding events/competitions, hackathons offer several fun mini-events, educational workshops, sponsor fairs, and an overall great atmosphere to hang out in!",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely nothing! We'll take care of food, prizes, swag, and more :)",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't know how to code?",
      answer:
        "That's completely fine - in fact, many participants are first time hackers and beginners!",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is there an application?",
      answer:
        "The application isn't rigorous at all; we use the term more like registration in the unlikely case that we shoot way over our logistical limit. It only takes a few minutes to fill out and you can always change your mind about attending as the event approaches.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to make a project?",
      answer:
        "You're not required to make a project to attend, but we recommend that you do in order to get the full hackathon experience.",
    },

    {
      question: "Can I attend?",
      answer:
        "Hack the Nest is open to all high school students of all experience levels from anywhere. If you're not in high school, we'd love to have you as a mentor, volunteer, or sponsor!",
    },
    {
      question: "How do teams work?",
      answer:
        "There are up to four people per team and you get to choose who you work with, so bring your friends along! Don't worry if you don't have a team; we have a dedicated team formation Discord channel as well as a team formation session at the beginning of the event.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where is the hackathon being held?",
